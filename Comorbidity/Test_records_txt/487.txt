BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
59 yo F with DM , HTN , OSA , s/p CVA admitted for
hypoxia to 70s. She experienced similar SOB on prior
episodes. She has had no CP. Her SOB is primarily related to her body
habitus.
IN AHS ED , hypoxic to 80s on RA , up to 90s on 3L NC. Had clear CXR ,
Patient's prior PE protocol was negitive though she did have a positive
D-Dimer. In ED EKG was w/ inf lat ST segment depressoions that were
unchanged from prior. She also has LA enlargement. While in ED patient's
troponin returned 1.64 ( prior less than assay a couple of days PTA ).
PE: 98.4 80 163/81 98% on 3L L homonomous hemianopsia , Chest clear.
JVP 12-15. 3/6 SM at LUSB. 2+ non-pitting LLE edema , 1+ RLE
edema CK130 MB9.0 Tn1.64
************************************************
Impression: 59 yo F with DM , OSA , HTN , s/p CVA with hypoxia likely
2/2 OSA here w/ likely demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoxia.* Pulm HTN
is also a possibility as a cause for her desaturation and SOB , but past
echo was unable to get PA pressure due to body habitus. Mainstay of
treatment now seems to be good respiratory rehab , use of CPAP in PM and
ultimately weight reduction.
CV: I- ruled out ACS w/ serial enzymes. Gave ASA , Lipitor 80 , heparin ,
ACE-I , low dose beta-blocker ( low dose as has COPD/reactive airway ).
PULM: Hypoxia at baseline. Recent PE-CT neg. Last admission her D-Dimer
was elevated but it was also elevated 5 years ago. Overall PE was not
leading diagnosis. On albuterol and nasacort. ABG with acidosis and
co2 retention in addition to sig Aa gradient , bipap and O2. No
facial BIPAP in house.
ENDO: DM. On NPH and humolog. Covering with RISS. TSH nml
PSYCH: On lexapro
PPX: Heparin
