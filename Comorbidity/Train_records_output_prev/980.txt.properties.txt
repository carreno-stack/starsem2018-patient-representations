HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was initially admitted to the short

stay unit and was given fluid for two days and

all of her medications were held.
"medications"
 	Drug
 	 	C0013227 Pharmaceutical Preparations

She was admitted to the

Cardiology Service , however on April , 2000 , she had been inhouse
"Service"
 	Finding
 	 	C0557854 Services

with that being her fourth day.

Her cardiac medications were
"cardiac"
 	Anatomy
 	 	C0018787 Heart
"medications"
 	Drug
 	 	C0013227 Pharmaceutical Preparations

progressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mg
"Imdur"
 	Drug
 	 	C0590690 Imdur

p.o. b.i.d.

Her course is notable for progressive decline in her

BUN and creatinine.

 	Procedure
 	 	C0005845 Blood urea nitrogen measurement

 	 	C0010294 Creatinine

On April , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at
"Lisinopril"
 	Drug
 	 	C0065374 Lisinopril

10 mg b.i.d.

She came in on 20 mg b.i.d.

She did fine with this.

The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her dose
"Torsemide"
 	Drug
 	 	C0076840 torsemide

of Lisinopril.
"Lisinopril"
 	Drug
 	 	C0065374 Lisinopril

This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinine

 	 	C0005845 Blood urea nitrogen measurement
"creatinine"
 	Drug
 	 	C0010294 Creatinine

back up to around 2.8 from 1.9.

Because she diuresed a total of

about 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increase

dose of Lisinopril.
"Lisinopril"
 	Drug
 	 	C0065374 Lisinopril

We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. and

continued her Torsemide.
