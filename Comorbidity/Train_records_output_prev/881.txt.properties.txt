care providers and other medically necessary interventions.

The

patient refused multiple evaluations by psychiatry to evaluate for

competence as the patient often did not want to listen when

attempts to explain to her her medical problems and the

consequences concerning medical decisions were attempted.

Finally

on October , the patient did try to leave AMA during the night ,

and on the morning of March another psychiatric evaluation was

performed and the patient was declared incompetent by psychiatry ,

and the decision was made to proceed with medically necessary care

despite the patient's unwillingness to comply , and we have begun

the pursuit of her guardianship for this patient.

The patient's

sister has agreed to pursue the role as her guardian.

Until that

time , the patient will be restrained physically or chemically as

necessary for medically necessary intervention.

Psychiatry is

continuing to follow.
