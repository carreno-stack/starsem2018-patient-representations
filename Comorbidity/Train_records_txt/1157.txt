BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

HPI: History was obtained from patient , who is a poor historian. He is
an 83 yo man with a history of CAD s/p MI in 1973 , s/p CABG x3 , T2DM ,
hypertension who presents "feeling sick" since last night. He states
that he took a Percocet for back pain and that after that he began to
feel numb in his arms and legs and around his head. He also had some
chest pressure. He took some SL nitro and doesn't remember if it helped.
Says it also wasn't relieved by positional change or rest. He denies
shortness of breath. He was having some nausea but no vomiting. He does
have some blurry vision at baseline , unchanged. He awoke this morning
and took his blood pressure. When he found his systolic was 190 , he
called EMS. He said he felt dizzy , "like I have pressure in my head , "
and could not describe it beyond that. He states that when his BP is
elevated his head feels like this and he gets flushed in the face.-----
